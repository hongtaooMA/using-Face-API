# using-Face-API
You can use a software and take screenshots from a video(such softwares are common and you can Google it)
Rename the screenshots as "10""20""30"... I used mac to rename the imgs and there is always a "0" in the unit digit, but you can also use programming to rename the imgs and change the codes where I defined the names of imgs
Change the path of imgs to yours and run the program, then input "1" and the program starts running, when it finishes the total number you settled in the program, it requires another input. Type "end" and you can get the Excel with attributes: gender, age, smile, emotion, beauty and etc. Take a look at the Face++ official site for that API and you can add more attributes if you need.
